# 2013-10-12, v0.2.0

- Fix possible segfault loading rules; Fixes #1

- Don't stop on failure to load a rule, simply skip it
We do, however, stop if no rule was loaded (since there's nothing to do).

- Add error when no rules are loading from a file

- Add options --verbose && --quiet

- Add support for $'FIELD in trigger


# 2013-10-06, v0.1.0

- first release, still in development phase
